#ZORCRAFT

Zorcraft is an experimental project which will be a *complete* game soon (I hope, at least).

Main purpose of this project is to have a good understanding of the isometric maps. I used to try to develop these kind of games in the past but none of them succeeded (shocker!). So I hope this one won't be one of them.
